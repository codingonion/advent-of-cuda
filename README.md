# advent-of-cuda

I want to get better at writing cuda kernels so I plan on doing advent of code
with cuda.

You can follow along here.

This for [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).

Some days problems wont be able to be solved this way, but we will just take
them as we go!

You will need cuda installed and llvm, [see
here](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/blob/master/guide/src/guide/getting_started.md).
